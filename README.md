### About
The SLEEPy is a very simple Python adaptation of the ArcGIS™ extension SLEEP (Soil–Landscape Estimation and Evaluation Program). SLEEP is a software, developed by Ziadat et al., 2015, that uses Pedo-transfer functions to provide the spatial distribution of the necessary unmapped soil data needed for SWAT model predictions (http://www.doi.org/10.3965/j.ijabe.20150803.1270). The scripts were developed for the interpreter Python 2.7.15 and 3.6.9.
